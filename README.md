# 🌍 LandVest - UK Land Investment Platform

## Overview
LandVest is the UK's first AI-powered platform dedicated exclusively to **LAND investment** (not property). We help both UK and international investors discover, evaluate, and acquire land with development potential.

## 🎯 Key Differentiators

### Why LAND, Not Property?
- **LAND** = Raw ground with development potential (10-100x returns possible)
- **Property** = Buildings requiring maintenance (2-3x returns typical)
- No tenants, no maintenance, pure capital appreciation
- Simpler legal process (4-8 weeks vs 8-12 weeks)
- Lower entry costs (from £10k vs £200k+)

### Foreign Investor Focus (40% of market)
- 🇨🇳 Chinese investors (£13B/year)
- 🇦🇪 Middle East investors (£8B/year)  
- 🇸🇬 Singapore investors (£5B/year)
- 🇺🇸 US investors (£4B/year)
- 🇭🇰 Hong Kong investors (£3B/year)
